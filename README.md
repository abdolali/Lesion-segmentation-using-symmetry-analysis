# Lesion-segmentation-using-symmetry-analysis<br />

All Images are belong to a patient <br />
"Maxilla_1" and "Maxilla_1_Loop_after_flip_2" are for 2D segmentaion<br />
(it's necessary to add siftDemoV4 and SYM to matlab path, and also download MIRT toolbox for registration)<br />

"*.exe" files are from nifti_Reg toolbox for 3D image registration<br />
Implementation of the following paper:<br />
Abdolali F, Zoroofi RA, Otake Y, Sato Y. Automatic segmentation of maxillofacial cysts in cone beam CT images. Computers in biology and medicine. 2016 May 1;72:108-19.
